# Salary_Prediction_Using_Linear_Regression
In this project I've used linear regression to predict the salaries.

Project Description:
In this project, I am using a dataset that contains information like, experience, previous interview score, current salaries and using that to predict salaries of employees.
However, before going ahead making a prediction, I am first pre-processing the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise.
In addition, I tried techniques in order to gain the best accuracy in my predictions.

Column details:
1. experience- how much experience does the employee have
2. test_score(out of 10) - test score of the employee out of 10
3. interview_score(out of 10) â€“ interview score of the employee out of 10
